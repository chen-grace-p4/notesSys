Processes
- every running program is a process
- a process can create subprocesses, but these are no different from regular processes
- a processor can handle 1 process per cycle (per core)
- multitasking appears to happen because the processor switches between all the active processes quickly.

pid
- every process has a unique identifier called the pid
- pid 1 is in the init core process
- getpid() - <unistd.h>
	returns the current process' pid as int
- getppid() - <unistd.h>
	returns the current process' parent pid
