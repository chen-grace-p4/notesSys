good to always include:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

**important to keep in mind that function header in both the .c and .h files should be the same
if you add (include "filename.h" to the "filename.c"), it will then recognize conflicting types ****
might cause multiple declarations of the same functions

to get error and know problem:
#ifndef EULER_H
#define EULER_H
 {function headers for euler.c}
#endif

AND

include "filename.h" to "filename.c"
------------------------------------------
pointers:
int *p = &x

0 is false so if you want to see if pointer exists, see if pointer is 0 (original)
